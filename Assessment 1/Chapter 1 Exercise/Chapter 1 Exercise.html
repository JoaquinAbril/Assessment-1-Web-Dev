    <ol>  <!-- This element is the "Ordered List" represents an ordered list of items, typically rendered as a numbered list -->
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti according to package instructions until al dente. Drain well, reserving 1/2 cup of pasta water.</li> <!-- This element is used to represent an item inside a list -->
        <li>In a large skillet, cook the diced pancetta over medium heat until crisp and golden brown. Add minced garlic and cook for another minute.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, whisk together eggs, grated Parmesan, and grated Pecorino Romano cheese until well combined.</li>
        <li>Remove the skillet from heat and add the cooked spaghetti to the pan with the pancetta and garlic. Toss to combine.</li>
        <li>Quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot spaghetti, tossing continuously until the eggs thicken but do not scramble (the residual heat from the pasta will cook the eggs). If the sauce is too thick, add some of the reserved pasta water to loosen it.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and plenty of freshly ground black pepper. Garnish with chopped parsley if desired. Serve immediately.</li>
